// MurmurHash2, by Austin Appleby

// Note - This code makes a few assumptions about how your machine behaves -

// 1. We can read a 4-byte value from any address without crashing
// 2. sizeof(int) == 4

// And it has a few limitations -

// 1. It will not work incrementally.
// 2. It will not produce the same results on little-endian and big-endian
//    machines.
