.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
\fBpcre-config\fP returns the configuration of the installed PCRE
libraries and the options required to compile a program to use them. Some of
the options apply only to the 8-bit, or 16-bit, or 32-bit libraries,
respectively, and are
not available if only one of those libraries has been built. If an unavailable
option is encountered, the "usage" information is output.

.SH OPTIONS
.rs
.TP 10
\fB--prefix\fP
Writes the directory prefix used in the PCRE installation for architecture
independent files (\fI/usr\fP on many systems, \fI/usr/local\fP on some
systems) to the standard output.
.TP 10
\fB--exec-prefix\fP
Writes the directory prefix used in the PCRE installation for architecture
dependent files (normally the same as \fB--prefix\fP) to the standard output.
.TP 10
\fB--version\fP
Writes the version number of the installed PCRE libraries to the standard
output.
.TP 10
\fB--libs\fP
Writes to the standard output the command line options required to link
with the 8-bit PCRE library (\fB-lpcre\fP on many systems).
.TP 10
\fB--libs16\fP
Writes to the standard output the command line options required to link
with the 16-bit PCRE library (\fB-lpcre16\fP on many systems).
.TP 10
\fB--libs32\fP
Writes to the standard output the command line options required to link
with the 32-bit PCRE library (\fB-lpcre32\fP on many systems).
.TP 10
\fB--libs-cpp\fP
Writes to the standard output the command line options required to link with
PCRE's C++ wrapper library (\fB-lpcrecpp\fP \fB-lpcre\fP on many
systems).
.TP 10
\fB--libs-posix\fP
Writes to the standard output the command line options required to link with
PCRE's POSIX API wrapper library (\fB-lpcreposix\fP \fB-lpcre\fP on many
systems).
.TP 10
\fB--cflags\fP
Writes to the standard output the command line options required to compile
files that use PCRE (this may include some \fB-I\fP options, but is blank on
many systems).
.TP 10
\fB--cflags-posix\fP
Writes to the standard output the command line options required to compile
files that use PCRE's POSIX API wrapper library (this may include some \fB-I\fP
options, but is blank on many systems).
