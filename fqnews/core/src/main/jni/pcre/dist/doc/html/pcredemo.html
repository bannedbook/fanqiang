*           PCRE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM           *
*************************************************/

/* This is a demonstration program to illustrate the most straightforward ways
of calling the PCRE regular expression library from a C program. See the
pcresample documentation for a short discussion ("man pcresample" if you have
the PCRE man pages installed).

In Unix-like environments, if PCRE is installed in your standard system
libraries, you should be able to compile this program using this command:

gcc -Wall pcredemo.c -lpcre -o pcredemo

If PCRE is not installed in a standard place, it is likely to be installed with
support for the pkg-config mechanism. If you have pkg-config, you can compile
this program using this command:

gcc -Wall pcredemo.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs libpcre` -o pcredemo

If you do not have pkg-config, you may have to use this:

gcc -Wall pcredemo.c -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib \
  -R/usr/local/lib -lpcre -o pcredemo

Replace "/usr/local/include" and "/usr/local/lib" with wherever the include and
library files for PCRE are installed on your system. Only some operating
systems (e.g. Solaris) use the -R option.

Building under Windows:

If you want to statically link this program against a non-dll .a file, you must
define PCRE_STATIC before including pcre.h, otherwise the pcre_malloc() and
pcre_free() exported functions will be declared __declspec(dllimport), with
unwanted results. So in this environment, uncomment the following line. */

* If the "-g" option was given on the command line, we want to continue  *

* might think because of the possibility of matching an empty string.    *
* What happens is as follows:                                            *
*                                                                        *
* If the previous match was NOT for an empty string, we can just start   *
* the next match at the end of the previous one.                         *
*                                                                        *
* If the previous match WAS for an empty string, we can't do that, as it *
* would lead to an infinite loop. Instead, a special call of pcre_exec() *
* is made with the PCRE_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART and PCRE_ANCHORED flags set.    *
* The first of these tells PCRE that an empty string at the start of the *
* subject is not a valid match; other possibilities must be tried. The   *
* second flag restricts PCRE to one match attempt at the initial string  *
* position. If this match succeeds, an alternative to the empty string   *
* match has been found, and we can print it and proceed round the loop,  *
* advancing by the length of whatever was found. If this match does not  *
* succeed, we still stay in the loop, advancing by just one character.   *
* In UTF-8 mode, which can be set by (*UTF8) in the pattern, this may be *
* more than one byte.                                                    *

* However, there is a complication concerned with newlines. When the     *
* newline convention is such that CRLF is a valid newline, we must       *
* advance by two characters rather than one. The newline convention can  *
* be set in the regex by (*CR), etc.; if not, we must find the default.  *

  Perl does: advance the matching position by one character, and continue. We
  do this by setting the "end of previous match" offset, because that is picked
  up at the top of the loop as the point at which to start again.
