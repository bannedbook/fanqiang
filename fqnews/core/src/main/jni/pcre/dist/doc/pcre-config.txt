NAME
       pcre-config - program to return PCRE configuration

SYNOPSIS

       pcre-config [--prefix] [--exec-prefix] [--version] [--libs]
                   [--libs16] [--libs32] [--libs-cpp] [--libs-posix]
                   [--cflags] [--cflags-posix]


DESCRIPTION

       pcre-config  returns  the configuration of the installed PCRE libraries
       and the options required to compile a program to use them. Some of  the
       options  apply  only  to  the  8-bit,  or  16-bit, or 32-bit libraries,
       respectively, and are not available if only one of those libraries  has
       been built. If an unavailable option is encountered, the "usage" infor-
       mation is output.


OPTIONS

       --prefix  Writes the directory prefix used in the PCRE installation for
                 architecture   independent   files  (/usr  on  many  systems,
                 /usr/local on some systems) to the standard output.

       --exec-prefix
                 Writes the directory prefix used in the PCRE installation for
                 architecture  dependent files (normally the same as --prefix)
                 to the standard output.

       --version Writes the version number of the installed PCRE libraries  to
                 the standard output.

       --libs    Writes  to  the  standard  output  the  command  line options
                 required to link with the 8-bit PCRE library (-lpcre on  many
                 systems).

       --libs16  Writes  to  the  standard  output  the  command  line options
                 required to link with the 16-bit PCRE  library  (-lpcre16  on
                 many systems).

       --libs32  Writes  to  the  standard  output  the  command  line options
                 required to link with the 32-bit PCRE  library  (-lpcre32  on
                 many systems).

       --libs-cpp
                 Writes  to  the  standard  output  the  command  line options
                 required to link with PCRE's C++ wrapper  library  (-lpcrecpp
                 -lpcre on many systems).

       --libs-posix
                 Writes  to  the  standard  output  the  command  line options
                 required to  link  with  PCRE's  POSIX  API  wrapper  library
                 (-lpcreposix -lpcre on many systems).

       --cflags  Writes  to  the  standard  output  the  command  line options
                 required to compile files that use  PCRE  (this  may  include
                 some -I options, but is blank on many systems).

       --cflags-posix
                 Writes  to  the  standard  output  the  command  line options
                 required to compile files that use PCRE's POSIX  API  wrapper
                 library  (this  may  include some -I options, but is blank on
                 many systems).
