.TH PCRESYNTAX 3 "08 January 2014" "PCRE 8.35"
.SH NAME
PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions
.SH "PCRE REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX SUMMARY"
.rs
.sp
The full syntax and semantics of the regular expressions that are supported by
PCRE are described in the
.\" HREF
\fBpcrepattern\fP
.\"
documentation. This document contains a quick-reference summary of the syntax.
.
.
.SH "QUOTING"
.rs
.sp
  \ex         where x is non-alphanumeric is a literal x
  \eQ...\eE    treat enclosed characters as literal
.
.
.SH "CHARACTERS"
.rs
.sp
  \ea         alarm, that is, the BEL character (hex 07)
  \ecx        "control-x", where x is any ASCII character
  \ee         escape (hex 1B)
  \ef         form feed (hex 0C)
  \en         newline (hex 0A)
  \er         carriage return (hex 0D)
  \et         tab (hex 09)
  \e0dd       character with octal code 0dd
  \eddd       character with octal code ddd, or backreference
  \eo{ddd..}  character with octal code ddd..
  \exhh       character with hex code hh
  \ex{hhh..}  character with hex code hhh..
.sp
Note that \e0dd is always an octal code, and that \e8 and \e9 are the literal
characters "8" and "9".
.
.
.SH "CHARACTER TYPES"
.rs
.sp
  .          any character except newline;
               in dotall mode, any character whatsoever
  \eC         one data unit, even in UTF mode (best avoided)
  \ed         a decimal digit
  \eD         a character that is not a decimal digit
  \eh         a horizontal white space character
  \eH         a character that is not a horizontal white space character
  \eN         a character that is not a newline
  \ep{\fIxx\fP}     a character with the \fIxx\fP property
  \eP{\fIxx\fP}     a character without the \fIxx\fP property
  \eR         a newline sequence
  \es         a white space character
  \eS         a character that is not a white space character
  \ev         a vertical white space character
  \eV         a character that is not a vertical white space character
  \ew         a "word" character
  \eW         a "non-word" character
  \eX         a Unicode extended grapheme cluster
.sp
By default, \ed, \es, and \ew match only ASCII characters, even in UTF-8 mode
or in the 16- bit and 32-bit libraries. However, if locale-specific matching is
happening, \es and \ew may also match characters with code points in the range
128-255. If the PCRE_UCP option is set, the behaviour of these escape sequences
is changed to use Unicode properties and they match many more characters.

.rs
.sp
  Xan        Alphanumeric: union of properties L and N
  Xps        POSIX space: property Z or tab, NL, VT, FF, CR
  Xsp        Perl space: property Z or tab, NL, VT, FF, CR
  Xuc        Univerally-named character: one that can be
               represented by a Universal Character Name
  Xwd        Perl word: property Xan or underscore
.sp
Perl and POSIX space are now the same. Perl added VT to its space character set
at release 5.18 and PCRE changed at release 8.34.

.SH "CHARACTER CLASSES"
.rs
.sp
  [...]       positive character class
  [^...]      negative character class
  [x-y]       range (can be used for hex characters)
  [[:xxx:]]   positive POSIX named set
  [[:^xxx:]]  negative POSIX named set
.sp
  alnum       alphanumeric
  alpha       alphabetic
  ascii       0-127
  blank       space or tab
  cntrl       control character
  digit       decimal digit

In PCRE, POSIX character set names recognize only ASCII characters by default,
but some of them use Unicode properties if PCRE_UCP is set. You can use
\eQ...\eE inside a character class.

  (*FAIL)         force backtrack; synonym (*F)
  (*MARK:NAME)    set name to be passed back; synonym (*:NAME)
.sp
The following act only when a subsequent match failure causes a backtrack to
reach them. They all force a match failure, but they differ in what happens
afterwards. Those that advance the start-of-match point do so only if the
pattern is not anchored.
.sp
  (*COMMIT)       overall failure, no advance of starting point
  (*PRUNE)        advance to next starting character
  (*PRUNE:NAME)   equivalent to (*MARK:NAME)(*PRUNE)
  (*SKIP)         advance to current matching position
  (*SKIP:NAME)    advance to position corresponding to an earlier
                  (*MARK:NAME); if not found, the (*SKIP) is ignored
  (*THEN)         local failure, backtrack to next alternation
  (*THEN:NAME)    equivalent to (*MARK:NAME)(*THEN)
