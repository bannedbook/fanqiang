.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
This function builds a set of character tables for character values less than
256. These can be passed to \fBpcre[16|32]_compile()\fP to override PCRE's
internal, built-in tables (which were made by \fBpcre[16|32]_maketables()\fP when
PCRE was compiled). You might want to do this if you are using a non-standard
locale. The function yields a pointer to the tables.
.P
There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the
.\" HREF
\fBpcreapi\fP
.\"
page and a description of the POSIX API in the
.\" HREF
\fBpcreposix\fP

page.
