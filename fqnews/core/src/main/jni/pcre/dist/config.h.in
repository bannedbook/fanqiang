/* PCRE is written in Standard C, but there are a few non-standard things it
can cope with, allowing it to run on SunOS4 and other "close to standard"
systems.

In environments that support the GNU autotools, config.h.in is converted into
config.h by the "configure" script. In environments that use CMake,
config-cmake.in is converted into config.h. If you are going to build PCRE "by
hand" without using "configure" or CMake, you should copy the distributed
config.h.generic to config.h, and edit the macro definitions to be the way you
need them. You must then add -DHAVE_CONFIG_H to all of your compile commands,
so that config.h is included at the start of every source.

Alternatively, you can avoid editing by using -D on the compiler command line
to set the macro values. In this case, you do not have to set -DHAVE_CONFIG_H,
but if you do, default values will be taken from config.h for non-boolean
macros that are not defined on the command line.

Boolean macros such as HAVE_STDLIB_H and SUPPORT_PCRE8 should either be defined
(conventionally to 1) for TRUE, and not defined at all for FALSE. All such
macros are listed as a commented #undef in config.h.generic. Macros such as
MATCH_LIMIT, whose actual value is relevant, have defaults defined, but are
surrounded by #ifndef/#endif lines so that the value can be overridden by -D.

PCRE uses memmove() if HAVE_MEMMOVE is defined; otherwise it uses bcopy() if
HAVE_BCOPY is defined. If your system has neither bcopy() nor memmove(), make
sure both macros are undefined; an emulation function will then be used. */

/* By default, the \R escape sequence matches any Unicode line ending
   character or sequence of characters. If BSR_ANYCRLF is defined (to any
   value), this is changed so that backslash-R matches only CR, LF, or CRLF.
   The build-time default can be overridden by the user of PCRE at runtime. */
#undef BSR_ANYCRLF

/* If you are compiling for a system that uses EBCDIC instead of ASCII
   character codes, define this macro to any value. You must also edit the
   NEWLINE macro below to set a suitable EBCDIC newline, commonly 21 (0x15).
   On systems that can use "configure" or CMake to set EBCDIC, NEWLINE is
   automatically adjusted. When EBCDIC is set, PCRE assumes that all input
   strings are in EBCDIC. If you do not define this macro, PCRE will assume
   input strings are ASCII or UTF-8/16/32 Unicode. It is not possible to build
   a version of PCRE that supports both EBCDIC and UTF-8/16/32. */

   NEWLINE macro below. On systems that can use "configure" or CMake to set
   EBCDIC_NL25, the adjustment of NEWLINE is automatic. */
