/*
 * Function pointer for a CGI script handler.
 *
 * This function is called each time the HTTPD server is asked for a file
 * whose name was previously registered as a CGI function using a call to
 * http_set_cgi_handler. The iIndex parameter provides the index of the
 * CGI within the ppcURLs array passed to http_set_cgi_handler. Parameters
 * pcParam and pcValue provide access to the parameters provided along with
 * the URI. iNumParams provides a count of the entries in the pcParam and
 * pcValue arrays. Each entry in the pcParam array contains the name of a
 * parameter with the corresponding entry in the pcValue array containing the
 * value for that parameter. Note that pcParam may contain multiple elements
 * with the same name if, for example, a multi-selection list control is used
 * in the form generating the data.
 *
 * The function should return a pointer to a character string which is the
 * path and filename of the response that is to be sent to the connected
 * browser, for example "/thanks.htm" or "/response/error.ssi".
 *
 * The maximum number of parameters that will be passed to this function via
 * iNumParams is defined by LWIP_HTTPD_MAX_CGI_PARAMETERS. Any parameters in the incoming
 * HTTP request above this number will be discarded.
 *
 * Requests intended for use by this CGI mechanism must be sent using the GET
 * method (which encodes all parameters within the URI rather than in a block
 * later in the request). Attempts to use the POST method will result in the
 * request being ignored.

 * Function pointer for the SSI tag handler callback.
 *
 * This function will be called each time the HTTPD server detects a tag of the
 * form <!--#name--> in a .shtml, .ssi or .shtm file where "name" appears as
 * one of the tags supplied to http_set_ssi_handler in the ppcTags array.  The
 * returned insert string, which will be appended after the the string
 * "<!--#name-->" in file sent back to the client,should be written to pointer
 * pcInsert.  iInsertLen contains the size of the buffer pointed to by
 * pcInsert.  The iIndex parameter provides the zero-based index of the tag as
 * found in the ppcTags array and identifies the tag that is to be processed.
 *
 * The handler returns the number of characters written to pcInsert excluding
 * any terminating NULL or a negative number to indicate a failure (tag not
 * recognized, for example).
 *
 * Note that the behavior of this SSI mechanism is somewhat different from the
 * "normal" SSI processing as found in, for example, the Apache web server.  In
 * this case, the inserted text is appended following the SSI tag rather than
 * replacing the tag entirely.  This allows for an implementation that does not
 * require significant additional buffering of output data yet which will still
 * offer usable SSI functionality.  One downside to this approach is when
 * attempting to use SSI within JavaScript.  The SSI tag is structured to
 * resemble an HTML comment but this syntax does not constitute a comment
 * within JavaScript and, hence, leaving the tag in place will result in
 * problems in these cases.  To work around this, any SSI tag which needs to
 * output JavaScript code must do so in an encapsulated way, sending the whole
 * HTML <script>...</script> section as a single include.
