1 Supported PPP protocols and features
======================================

Supported Low level protocols:
* PPP over serial using HDLC-like framing, such as wired dialup modems
  or mobile telecommunications GPRS/EDGE/UMTS/HSPA+/LTE modems
* PPP over Ethernet, such as xDSL modems
* PPP over L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) LAC (L2TP Access Concentrator),
  IP tunnel over UDP, such as VPN access

* VJ, Van Jacobson TCP/IP Header Compression



2 Raw API PPP example for all protocols
=======================================

As usual, raw API for lwIP means the lightweight API which *MUST* only be used
for NO_SYS=1 systems or called inside lwIP core thread for NO_SYS=0 systems.

3 PPPoS input path (raw API, IRQ safe API, TCPIP API)
=====================================================

Received data on serial port should be sent to lwIP using the pppos_input()
function or the pppos_input_tcpip() function.

If NO_SYS is 1 and if PPP_INPROC_IRQ_SAFE is 0 (the default), pppos_input()
is not IRQ safe and then *MUST* only be called inside your main loop.

Whatever the NO_SYS value, if PPP_INPROC_IRQ_SAFE is 1, pppos_input() is IRQ
safe and can be safely called from an interrupt context, using that is going
to reduce your need of buffer if pppos_input() is called byte after byte in
your rx serial interrupt.

if NO_SYS is 0, the thread safe way outside an interrupt context is to use
the pppos_input_tcpip() function to pass input data to the lwIP core thread
using the TCPIP API. This is thread safe in all cases but you should avoid
passing data byte after byte because it uses heavy locking (mailbox) and it
allocates pbuf, better fill them !

if NO_SYS is 0 and if PPP_INPROC_IRQ_SAFE is 1, you may also use pppos_input()
from an RX thread, however pppos_input() is not thread safe by itself. You can
do that *BUT* you should NEVER call pppos_connect(), pppos_listen() and
ppp_free() if pppos_input() can still be running, doing this is NOT thread safe
at all. Using PPP_INPROC_IRQ_SAFE from an RX thread is discouraged unless you
really know what you are doing, your move ;-)


/*
 * Fonction to call for received data
 *
 * ppp, PPP control block
 * buffer, input buffer
 * buffer_len, buffer length in bytes
 */
void pppos_input(ppp, buffer, buffer_len);

or

void pppos_input_tcpip(ppp, buffer, buffer_len);



4 Thread safe PPP API (PPPAPI)
==============================

There is a thread safe API for all corresponding ppp_* functions, you have to
enable LWIP_PPP_API in your lwipopts.h file, then see
include/netif/ppp/pppapi.h, this is actually pretty obvious.



5 Notify phase callback (PPP_NOTIFY_PHASE)
==========================================

Notify phase callback, enabled using the PPP_NOTIFY_PHASE config option, let
you configure a callback that is called on each PPP internal state change.
This is different from the status callback which only warns you about
up(running) and down(dead) events.

Notify phase callback can be used, for example, to set a LED pattern depending
on the current phase of the PPP session. Here is a callback example which
tries to mimic what we usually see on xDSL modems while they are negotiating
the link, which should be self-explanatory:

static void ppp_notify_phase_cb(ppp_pcb *pcb, u8_t phase, void *ctx) {
  switch (phase) {

  /* Session is down (either permanently or briefly) */
  case PPP_PHASE_DEAD:
    led_set(PPP_LED, LED_OFF);
    break;

  /* We are between two sessions */
  case PPP_PHASE_HOLDOFF:
    led_set(PPP_LED, LED_SLOW_BLINK);
    break;

  /* Session just started */
  case PPP_PHASE_INITIALIZE:
    led_set(PPP_LED, LED_FAST_BLINK);
    break;

  /* Session is running */
  case PPP_PHASE_RUNNING:
    led_set(PPP_LED, LED_ON);
    break;

  default:
    break;
  }
}



6 Upgrading from lwIP <= 1.4.x to lwIP >= 2.0.x
===============================================

PPP API was fully reworked between 1.4.x and 2.0.x releases. However porting
from previous lwIP version is pretty easy:

* Previous PPP API used an integer to identify PPP sessions, we are now
  using ppp_pcb* control block, therefore all functions changed from "int ppp"
  to "ppp_pcb *ppp"

* struct netif was moved outside the PPP structure, you have to provide a netif
  for PPP interface in pppoX_create() functions

* PPP session are not started automatically after you created them anymore,
  you have to call ppp_connect(), this way you can configure the session before
  starting it.

* Previous PPP API used CamelCase, we are now using snake_case.

* Previous PPP API mixed PPPoS and PPPoE calls, this isn't the case anymore,
  PPPoS functions are now prefixed pppos_ and PPPoE functions are now prefixed
  pppoe_, common functions are now prefixed ppp_.

* New PPPERR_ error codes added, check you have all of them in your status
  callback function

* Only the following include files should now be used in user application:
  #include "netif/ppp/pppapi.h"
  #include "netif/ppp/pppos.h"
  #include "netif/ppp/pppoe.h"
  #include "netif/ppp/pppol2tp.h"

  Functions from ppp.h can be used, but you don't need to include this header
  file as it is already included by above header files.

* PPP_INPROC_OWNTHREAD was broken by design and was removed, you have to create
  your own serial rx thread

* PPP_INPROC_MULTITHREADED option was misnamed and confusing and was renamed
  PPP_INPROC_IRQ_SAFE, please read the "PPPoS input path" documentation above
  because you might have been fooled by that

* If you used tcpip_callback_with_block() on ppp_ functions you may wish to use
  the PPPAPI API instead.

* ppp_sighup and ppp_close functions were merged using an optional argument
  "nocarrier" on ppp_close.

* DNS servers are now only remotely asked if LWIP_DNS is set and if
  ppp_set_usepeerdns() is set to true, they are now automatically registered
  using the dns_setserver() function so you don't need to do that in the PPP
  callback anymore.

* PPPoS does not use the SIO API anymore, as such it now requires a serial
  output callback in place of sio_write

* PPP_MAXIDLEFLAG is now in ms instead of jiffies
