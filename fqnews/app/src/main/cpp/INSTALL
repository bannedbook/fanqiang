Polipo installation instructions
================================

1. Building and running polipo
------------------------------

    $ make all
    $ su -c 'make install'
    $ man polipo
    $ polipo &

If you want Polipo to put itself into the background, you may replace
the last line with:

    $ polipo daemonise=true logFile="/var/log/polipo.log"

On SVR4 systems (Solaris, HP/UX), you will need to use one of the
following (whichever works):

    $ make PLATFORM_DEFINES=-DSVR4 all
    $ make PLATFORM_DEFINES=-DSVR4 LDLIBS='-lsocket -lnsl -lresolv' all

You can also use Polipo without installing:

    $ make
    $ nroff -man polipo.man | more
    $ ./polipo &

For information about building on Windows, please see the file README.Windows.

2. Configuring your user-agent
------------------------------

Once polipo is running, configure your user-agent (web browser) to use
the proxy on `http://localhost:8123/'.  Depending on the user-agent,
this is done either by setting the environment variable http_proxy,
e.g.

    $ http_proxy=http://localhost:8123; export http_proxy

or by using the browser's ``preferences'' menu.

3. Configuring polipo
---------------------

If you want to use an on-disk cache, you will need to create its root
directory:

    $ mkdir /var/cache/polipo/

You should then arrange for cron to run the following on a regular
basis:

    killall -USR1 polipo
    sleep 1
    polipo -x
    killall -USR2 polipo

If you want to use a configuration file, you should put it in one of
the locations `/etc/polipo/config' or `~/.polipo'; you can also use
the `-c' flag to put it in a non-standard location.  See the file
`config.sample' for an example.

You might also want to create a forbidden URLs file, which you should
put either in one of `/etc/polipo/forbidden' or `~/.polipo-forbidden';
you can set the variable `forbiddenFile' in your config file if you
want to put it in a non-standard location.  See `forbidden.sample' for
an example.
